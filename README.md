Description: This repository is for all code written as a summer student in the Seaman MRI Center 2022. 
Comp UNet is the code I'm working on, and is as suggested a complex UNet.
The other UNet is a regular UNet.
In the photos folder, format is "Epochs"_"Pictures used"_"Mod variable"_"Time taken".

---

Status: CompUnet is working, although I'm not sure if it's fundamentally correct. Once that is confirmed, I'll be working 
towards sending larger scale jobs to ARC. I've registered for an account, but have been unable to connect to ARC so maybe
the account isn't working yet.
