Duncan Boyd, June 2, 2022

This repository is for all code written as a summer student in the Seaman MRI Center 2022. 

Comp UNet is the code I'm working on, and is as suggested a complex UNet.

The other UNet is a regular UNet.

In the photos folder, format is "Epochs"_"Pictures used"_"Mod variable"_"Time taken".
