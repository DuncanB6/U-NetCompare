Description: This repository is for all code written as a summer student in the Seaman MRI Center 2022. 
Comp UNet is the code I'm working on, and is as suggested a complex UNet, as well as a regular UNet.
The other UNet is a regular UNet.

Status: Currently working to improve usabiity and ready it for large scale testing. Once that's done, I'll be working 
towards sending larger scale jobs to ARC.
